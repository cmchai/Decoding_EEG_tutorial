# Decoding_EEG_tutorial
This is the repository to store and update the Python script that [Dr.Raquel London](https://www.raquellondon.com/) and I created for a tutorial that we gave at [CuttingGardens 2023](https://github.com/eeg-ugent/Ghent_CuttingGardens2023). It is a hands-on tutorial that focus on information decoding from EEG signals. The teaching material was heavily inspired by the tutorial given by [Dr.Britta Westner](https://britta-wstnr.github.io/) at [PracticalMEEG 2022](https://practicalmeeg2022.org/) the year before. 

## Example data
You can download the data used in the tutorial from [here](https://zenodo.org/records/7602381).

## Bugs and improvement
if you run into issues when openning or running this script, or your think something can be improved, please contact the author \(chaimengqiao@\[gmail\].com\).
